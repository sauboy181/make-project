# **Maze Runner**
This is a 2D game made using Python and a set of modules designed for writing video games called pygame. Find your way out of each maze before time runs out!


Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move around and find your way out to the maze. Once you reach the end of the maze, you will be greeted by a friend who will guide you to the play again screen. There, you can choose to play again or quit. Thank you for playing!
