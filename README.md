# **Maze Runner**
by Michael Sau and Wilson Hsu

This is a 2D game made using Python and a set of modules designed for writing video games called Pygame. Find your way out of each maze before time runs out!

Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move around and find the princess at the end of the maze. Try to find the princess as fast as possible! Thank you for playing!


This was used for educational purposes for the Make Project. Read on for our process, reflection in all of this. 

As first time coders, we never expected to be able to pull off something like this. While brainstorming a couple of different ideas to do for this particular Make project, several things went through our heads. We thought of improving our APIs, but unfortunately, I was not a Lord of the Rings Fan, and he did not know the Riot Games games. We tried to find commonalities so that both of us could get something out of this project. While at work, I saw someone play a game on their Nintendo Switch, and I jokingly told my partner that we should make a pokemon game. Little did we know that we would eventually make that joke a reality.

As both of us grew up playing games like Pokemon, we wanted to see if we could make our own version of the game. Although many things could have been incorporated, we wanted to first build a program where you could choose your character, go through a maze, and have a win condition. In our eyes, that was the foundation of the Pokemon game. Ultimately, this might be something we continue to work on moving forward, and create a fan made Pokemon game. Or maybe we branch out and do something else with it. Needless to say, we were super fortunate to be able to take this course and learn the foundations of python in order to incorporate into this game. 

One of the very first challenges that we went through was the debate of python vs. Java. At the time, we were working on a Pac Man code on Java, but we did not feel as equipped and comfortable as we did with Python. Because of this we decided to use python. While doing some research, we stumbled on Pygame, which was a set of modules built for games. After looking up documentation and watching a couple videos, we realized how realistic it was to actually do this. We decide to fully commit to this game idea, and began with a GitHub. Setting up GitHub was a little challenging as well. Creating a repository, going through pull requests, all the weird nuances to GitHub was something that we had to go through. But in the end, we were able to build our own little repository and upload our code onto it.

In terms of the actual code, I think that there were a lot of references needed, and a lot of logic planning on our own end to figure it out. We first created our logic, where you would choose a character, they would be able to move througha. maze of some sort, and then get to a destination/ meet somebody to "win the game." And our code reflected just that, we created a screen that allowed the player to choose a character, a map was initialized with trees and houses, and they have to find a princess in order to reach their "win condition." Though it sounds simple, it was actually quite difficult to accomplish those things. A lot of things went wrong. There was one instance where I did not even know how to initialize the software, and that rainbow wheel spinning on our Macs made our lives so stressful. We would initiate the game and pray that the system would work. 

Overall, we think that GitHub really helped us stay organized and made sure that we were keeping each other accountable for the code!
